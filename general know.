 let { startDate, endDate }: any = req.query;
 The code is using object destructuring to extract the startDate and endDate properties from the req.query object

req.query: This likely refers to an object containing the query parameters from an HTTP request. 
In frameworks like Express.js, req.query represents the query parameters parsed from the URL.

So, putting it all together, this line of code extracts the startDate and endDate properties from the req.query object and assigns them to 
variables with the same names, and TypeScript is instructed to treat these variables as having the type any, meaning their types are not strictly enforced.
