the most powerful features of RabbitMQ is its support for the publish-subscribe messaging pattern. In this pattern, messages are sent to a topic or exchange, and 
are then distributed to all the queues that are bound to that exchange.
  
What are Service Bus topics and subscriptions?
Service Bus topics and subscriptions support a publish/subscribe messaging communication model. 
When you use topics and subscriptions, components of a distributed application don't communicate directly with each other; 
instead they exchange messages via a topic, which acts as an intermediary.

   ROUTING:
Messages are not published directly to a queue. Instead, the producer sends messages to an exchange. Exchanges are message routing agents, defined by the virtual host within RabbitMQ. An exchange is responsible for routing the messages to different queues with the help of header attributes, bindings, and routing keys.

A binding is a "link" that you set up to bind a queue to an exchange.
The routing key is a message attribute the exchange looks at when deciding 
how to route the message to queues (depending on exchange type).
